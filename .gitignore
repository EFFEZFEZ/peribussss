Got it. I have created the `.gitignore` file for your project with the exact rules you provided. This is a crucial step to protect your data and keep your repository clean.

### `.gitignore`

```
# GTFS Data Files (user will provide their own)
public/data/gtfs/*.txt
public/data/map.geojson

# Keep directory structure
!public/data/gtfs/.gitkeep
!public/data/.gitkeep

# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# IDE files
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp
*.swo

# Logs
*.log
npm-debug.log*

# Temporary files
*.tmp
*.temp
```
